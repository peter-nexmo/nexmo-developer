Carriers return a delivery receipt (DLR) to Nexmo to explain the delivery status of your message. If the message is not received, the delivery receipt explains why your message failed to arrive.

The delivery receipt is sent using a [GET] HTTP request to your [webhook endpoint](/concepts/guides/webhooks). When you receive the DLR, you must send a `200 OK` response. If you do not send the `200 OK`, Nexmo resends the delivery receipt for the next 72 hours.
