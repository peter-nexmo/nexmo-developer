# Alerts - Sending API Reference

This defines Event Based Alerts API:

* [Request](#request) - send an Event Based Alert to you user.  If you have multiple templates, remember to set the *template* number in your request.
* [Response](#response) - Check the `status` field to ensure that you sent the request to Nexmo correctly.
* [Delivery receipt](#delivery-receipt) - verify that the Event Based Alert was delivered.

## Request

Before calling this API, you need to configure your message in Nexmo [Dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com). A message template normally contains custom parameters that you supply in your request.

A basic Short Code Event Based Alert *request* looks like:

```
https://rest.nexmo.com/sc/us/alert/json?api_key=xxxxxxxx&api_secret=xxxxxxxx&to=xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

If you have a template in the form:

```
Your ${server} is down, for more details check ${link}
```

Your request will be:

```
https://rest.nexmo.com/sc/us/alert/json?api_key=xxxxxxxx&api_secret=xxxxxxxx&to=xxxxxxxxxxxx&server=host3&link=https://example.com/host3/mon
```

## Delivery Receipt

Each request you make using the Nexmo API returns a:

* Response - the status and cost of your request to Nexmo in JSON or XML format.
* Delivery Receipt - if you have set a webhook endpoint, Nexmo forwards this delivery receipt to it. Carriers return a Delivery Receipt (DLR) to Nexmo to explain the delivery status of your message. If the message is not received, the delivery receipt explains why your message failed to arrive.

The Delivery Receipt is sent using a [GET] HTTP request to your webhook endpoint. When you receive the DLR, you must send a 200 OK response. If you do not send the `200 OK`, Nexmo resends the delivery receipt for the next 72 hours. Please ensure that you have configured [a webhook endpoint](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/settings) in the Nexmo dashboard.

When you implement your response, ensure that your logic is not case-sensitive for the response codes.
