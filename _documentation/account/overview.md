# Account Overview

Your Nexmo account can be managed in a few different ways:

* Via the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/)
* Using the [CLI](/tools) (command line interface) tool
* By calling the [API](/api/account) directly or with one of the [Nexmo client libraries](/tools) for your preferred technology stack

Within your account you can check your balance, configure the account-level settings, and rotate your API secrets for security purposes.
