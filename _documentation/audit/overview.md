# Audit API Overview

The Nexmo Audit API enables you to monitor your account by tracking events. These events are generated when your account users work with the SDKs or interact with the Nexmo Dashboard.

With this API you can:

* Retrieve a list of Audit events.
* Retrieve a specific Audit event.
* Filter events by parameters such as date, user ID, and event type.

## Beta

This API is currently in Beta.

Nexmo always welcomes your feedback. Your suggestions help us improve the product. If you do need help, please email [support@nexmo.com](mailto:support@nexmo.com) and include Audit API in the subject line. Please note that during the Beta period support times are limited to Monday to Friday.

During the Beta period Nexmo may expand the capabilities of the Audit API.

## Authentication

Interactions with the Audit API are authenticated using Basic Authentication. Basic Authentication allows you to use your `NEXMO_API_KEY` and `NEXMO_API_SECRET` to validate your API requests. For more general information on authentication see [Authentication](/concepts/guides/authentication).

## Audit Events

Audit Events are activities that occur when a user interacts with the Nexmo API or the Nexmo Dashboard. Audit events are represented by a JSON object. Examples of audit events include:

* Account settings updates.
* A Nexmo Number gets assigned to an application.
* Creation of a Nexmo application.

Further information on types of audit events is given on the [Audit Events](/audit/concepts/audit-events) page.

## Audit Event object

An example audit event object is 'updating a number' which has `event_type` of `NUMBER_UPDATED`:

``` json
{
  "_links": {
    "self": {
      "href": "http://api.nexmo.com/beta/audit/events/aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-0123456789ab"
    }
  },
  "id": "aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-0123456789ab",
  "event_type": "NUMBER_UPDATED",
  "event_type_description": "Number updated",
  "created_at": "2018-08-13T10:15:31",
  "account_id": "abcd1234",
  "source": "DEVAPI",
  "source_ip": "154.59.142.233",
  "source_description": "Developer API",
  "source_country": "GB",
  "context": {
    "country": "GB",
    "msisdn": "447700900000",
    "voice-type": "sip",
    "voice-value": "sip:user@example12.com",
    "accountId": "abcd1234"
  }
}
```

## Getting Started

This example shows you how to get started with the Audit API. It demonstrates how to retrieve a list of audit events.

You will need to ensure that the following replaceable values are set in the example code using any convenient method:

Key | Description
-- | --
`NEXMO_API_KEY` | Your Nexmo API key.
`NEXMO_API_SECRET` | Your Nexmo API secret.

> In the following example the _Create an application_ and _Initialize your dependencies_ procedures are optional.

```code_snippets
source: '_examples/audit/get-events'
application:
  name: 'Get Audit Events'
```
