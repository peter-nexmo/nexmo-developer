# Send and Receive DTMF

> **NOTE**: This feature is currently supported only on Nexmo Client Android SDK.

## Overview

Dual Tone Multi Frequency (DTMF), is a form of signalling used by phone systems to transmit the digits `0`-`9` and the `*` and `#` characters. Typically a caller presses these buttons on their telephone keypad and the phone then generates a tone made up of two frequencies played simultaneously (hence Dual Tone).

DTMF is used both for dialing a destination on a landline telephone and also for signalling to the remote end once a call is answered. Typically this is used to implement an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system, or to enter information like a PIN number or conference call pin.

With Nexmo Client SDKs you can both collect a DTMF input from your app user, and listen to DTMF input that was sent from another member.

## Send DTMF

In order to send DTMF tones from your application to the backend, use this method:

```java
NexmoCall.sendDTMF(dtmf: String)
```

During an ongoing call, where your backend implemented an [NCCO with an Input action](/voice/voice-api/ncco-reference#input), sending a DTMF will trigger the defined `"eventUrl"`.

## Receive DTMF

Whenever a member in a `Conversation` or a `Call` sends a DTMF, all of the other members are notified about that event.

The DTMF events will be received in your implementation of `NexmoCallEventListener.onDTMF()` method, on the `NexmoCallEventListener` that is attached to the `NexmoCall`.

For example:

```java

callEventListener = object : NexmoCallEventListener {
    //…

    override fun onDTMF(dtmf: String, member: NexmoCallMember) {
        TODO(“implement DTMF received")
    }
}

currentCall?.addCallEventListener(callEventListener)

```
