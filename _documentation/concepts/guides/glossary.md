# Glossary

## 2FA

Two-factor authentication: unambiguous identification of users by means of the combination of two different components. For example, to withdraw cash from an ATM, you need both a card and a PIN code. These components may be something that the user knows, something that the user possesses or something that is inseparable from the user.

Many Nexmo customers authenticate their users by sending them a PIN code in an [SMS](#sms). The user authenticates by entering the PIN into the customer's UI. An example of usage is where the customer requires a password reset. In this case, the two components are the account details and possession of the phone number registered to that account.

See the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-factor_authentication).

See also the [Verify API documentation](/verify/overview).

## Adaptive Routing™

Adaptive Routing technology actively reroutes messages through the alternate carrier routes to ensure that messages are delivered in an optimal manner. It identifies the aggregator partners that are providing the best performance to a given destination, and as a result, both latency and performance volatility are reduced.

This technology in the Platform is an algorithm that actively monitors and dynamically adjusts the routes used to deliver SMS. The route choice is made using millions of real-time conversion data points.

## AR

See [Adaptive Routing](#adaptive-routing).

## Caller ID

The [Sender ID](#sender-id) for [voice](#voice) calls. Referred to as the CLI or ANI also.

## Carrier

A Telecommunications Service Provider. The company that a phone connects to is the target carrier for the phone number. You can also have intermediate carriers - Nexmo is one.

## CDR

Call Detail Record. CDRs completely describe a message or call and the submission state. Technically, this is data for a particular Request.

For more information on managing CDRs see the [Redact API documentation](/redact/overview).

## CLI

Nexmo Command Line Interface (CLI) tool. 

Further information can be found in the [CLI repository](https://github.com/Nexmo/nexmo-cli).

Also, Caller Line Identity. See [Caller ID](#caller-id)

## Client libraries

Nexmo provides client libraries for various programming languages. These client libraries allow you to develop
Nexmo applications quickly and reduce time to market.

Further information can be found on the [Nexmo Tools page](https://developer.nexmo.com/tools).

## Cloud number

A virtual number that is assigned to a customer's account and not a device. A virtual number can accept inbound SMS, Voice or both. Nexmo customers use these numbers for [Messaging](#messaging-api) or [Voice](#voice) communication.

See also [Virtual Number](#virtual-number).

## Conversions

The successful validation that a message was delivered to a user.

## Dashboard

See [Nexmo Dashboard](#nexmo-dashboard).

## Dedicated Short Codes

This is a Short Code used by a single Nexmo Customer. Unlike a Shared Short Code, Nexmo manages a lengthy application process in order to purchase a US short code for you. Customers can also transfer their current short code to Nexmo.

For more information see the [US Short Code documentation](/messaging/us-short-codes/overview).

## Delivery Receipt

When Nexmo sends an SMS to a Telecommunications Service Provider, they return a delivery receipt. Telecommunications Service Providers send the delivery receipt at a moment of their choice, they do not have to wait for delivery confirmation.

Delivery receipt can be either:

* Carrier - returned to Nexmo when the message is received by the Telecommunications Service Providers.
* Handset - returned to Nexmo when the message is received on your user's handset.

In practice, some Telecommunications Service Providers either do not send the delivery receipt or send a Fake DLR. Nexmo cannot be 100% certain that a "successfully delivered" delivery receipt means that the message reached the user.

If the message is not received, this delivery receipt explains why the message failed to arrive.

## Destination Number

The phone number a message or call is sent to. This is the `to` parameter in the Nexmo APIs.

## Direct-to-Carrier Network

The Platform is a globally distributed communication network based on direct integration with Telecommunications Service Providers. This provides zero-hop communication to most destinations worldwide. This results in lower latency and higher quality of delivery.

## DLR

See [Delivery Receipt](#delivery-receipt).

## DTMF

Dual Tone Multi Frequency. Typically used when dealing with data entered by the caller using their phone keyboard.

See [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-tone_multi-frequency_signaling).

For further information see the [Nexmo DTMF documentation](/voice/voice-api/guides/dtmf).

## Dynamic Caller ID

Enables you to present any phone number on your account as your outbound Caller ID. You can have multiple Caller IDs based on the number you are calling. For example, if you call someone in San Francisco from New York City, the recipient would only see a local San Francisco number on their phone.

## Dynamic phone number insertion

A measure of the impact of inbound phone calls in digital marketing efforts. For example, when a potential customer clicks on your site, dynamic phone number insertion will show a phone number that is unique to the search engine, website key terms or other sources.

## E.164 format

Phone number format for all Nexmo APIs.

This means that numbers:

* Omit both a leading `+` and the international access code such as `00` or `001`.
* Contain no special characters, such as a space, `(`, `)`, or `-`.

For example, a US number would have the format `14155550101`. A UK number would have the format `447700900123`.

If you are unsure how to format the number the Number Insight API can be used to find correct information about a number.

See [Number format](#number-format).

## Extended shortcode

A short number between 4 and 6 digits that has been extended to create a large pool of numbers.

## Fake Delivery Receipt

A [Delivery Receipt](#delivery-receipt) suspected to be fake. That is when there is no intention to deliver the SMS.

Sometimes delivery receipts are faked because the Telecommunications Service Provider sends it early. Some Telecommunications Service Providers never return a delivery receipt. In this case Nexmo creates a delivery receipt and sends it to you.

## Geo

The geographic region of the world.

## Handset Delivery Receipt

A [Delivery Receipt](#delivery-receipt) that is sent when the message is delivered to the user's handset.

## HLR

Home Location Register. These databases contain details of each subscriber phone number, including the current active status and more.

## Interactive Voice Response

Interactive Voice Response, or IVR, is an automated telephony technology that enables a human caller to interact with a computer using voice and DTMF tones input on a keypad.

See also the [Nexmo DTMF documentation](/voice/voice-api/guides/dtmf).

## Intermediate carrier

A Telecommunications Service Provider that does not own the wireless network infrastructure.

See [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_virtual_network_operator).

## IVR

See [Interactive Voice Response](#interactive-voice-response).

## Latency

The elapsed time between the moment a message is sent and when it is received. A delivery that encounters few or no delays has low latency. A delivery that encounters a significant amount of delay has high latency. The greater the number of hops associated with message delivery, the greater the number of opportunities for a delay — and higher latency.

## Live Handset Check

See [HLR](#hlr).

## Local Supplier
