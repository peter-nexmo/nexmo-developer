# Create an Event

In this code snippet you will see how to create an Event.

## Example

Ensure the following variables are set to your required values using any convenient method:

Key | Description
-- | --
`CONVERSATION_ID` | The unique ID of the Conversation.
`MEMBER_ID` | The unique ID of the Member.

```code_snippets
source: '_examples/conversation/event/create-event'
application:
  use_existing: |
    You will need to use an existing Application that contains a Conversation in order to be able to create an Event. See the Create Conversation code snippet for information on how to create an Application and some sample Conversations.
```
