# List Events

In this code snippet you will see how to list Events.

## Example

Ensure the following variables are set to your required values using any convenient method:

Key | Description
-- | --
`CONVERSATION_ID` | The unique ID of the Conversation.

```code_snippets
source: '_examples/conversation/event/list-events'
application:
  use_existing: |
    You will need to use an existing Application that contains a Conversation in order to be able to create Events and then list them. See the Create Conversation code snippet for information on how to create an Application and some sample Conversations.
```

## Try it out

When you run the code you will retrieve a list of Events.
