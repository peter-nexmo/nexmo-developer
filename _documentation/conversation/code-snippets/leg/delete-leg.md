# Delete a Leg

In this code snippet you will see how to delete a Leg.

## Example

Ensure the following variables are set to your required values using any convenient method:

Key | Description
-- | --
`LEG_ID` | The unique ID of the Leg.

```code_snippets
source: '_examples/conversation/leg/delete-leg'
application:
  use_existing: |
    You will need to use an existing Application that contains a Conversation and Legs in order to be able to delete a Leg. See the Create Conversation code snippet for information on how to create an Application and some sample Conversations. You can create Legs within that Conversation by making a Call as outlined in the Conversation topic and our tutorial `Retrieve Conversation details for an in-progress Call.`
```
