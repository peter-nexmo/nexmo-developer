# Update a Member

In this code snippet you will see how to update the details of a Member.

## Example

Ensure the following variables are set to your required values using any convenient method:

Key | Description
-- | --
`CONVERSATION_ID` | The unique ID of the Conversation.
`USER_ID` | The unique ID of the User.
`MEMBER_ID` | The unique ID of the member.

```code_snippets

  use_existing: |
    You will need to use an existing Application that contains a Conversation and at least one Member in order to be able to update a Member. See the Create Conversation code snippet for information on how to create an Application and some sample Conversations.
