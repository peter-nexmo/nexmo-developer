# Event

Conversations and other Nexmo objects such as Members and Applications generate Events. When key activities occur an event is generated, which can be handled by the application. For example when a User joins a Conversation a `member:joined` event is fired. Other events include `app:knocking`, and `conversation:created`.
Nexmo Application with `rtc` among its capabilities, will receive the dispatched event on the `rtc` `event_url` webhook.

## Handling Events

The following code snippet shows that code can be executed based on the event fired:

``` javascript
...
    events.forEach((value, key) => {
        if (conversation.members[value.from]) {
            const date = new Date(Date.parse(value.timestamp))
            switch (value.type) {
                case 'text:seen':
                    ...
                    break;
                case 'text:delivered':
                    ...
                    break;
                case 'text':
                    ...
                    break;
                case 'member:joined':
                    ...
                    break;
                case 'member:left':
                    ...
                    break;
                case 'member:invited':
                    ...
                    break;
                case 'member:media':
                    ...
                    break;
                default:
                ...
            }
        }
    })
...
```
