A Leg connects a [User](/conversation/concepts/user) with a [Conversation](/conversation/concepts/conversation) and enables voice or video to flow over a certain [Channel](/conversation/concepts/channel). Every time a Leg is created, it is assigned a unique ID.

The following diagram shows a [Call](/conversation/concepts/call) with two Legs:
