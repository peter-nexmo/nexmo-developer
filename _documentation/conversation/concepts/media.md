# Media

There are currently three supported media types:

1. Messaging
2. Voice
3. Video

You can build applications that provide communication over these media using the [Client SDK](/client-sdk/overview) and [VAPI](/voice/voice-api/overview).

See also [Channels](/conversation/concepts/channel).
