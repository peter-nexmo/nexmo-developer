# External Accounts

External Accounts are messaging (chatapp) accounts outside of Nexmo such as Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and Viber. You can link and unlink your Nexmo Messages and Dispatch applications to and from these external accounts either via the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/messages/your-applications) or by using the [External Accounts API](/messages/external-accounts/overview).
