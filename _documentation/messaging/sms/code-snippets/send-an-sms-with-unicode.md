# Sending an SMS with Unicode

Nexmo's SMS API supports Unicode characters too, which you will need to use when communicating with customers in Chinese, Japanese and Korean.

To send an SMS that contains Unicode characters, replace the following variables in the example below:

Key | Description
-- | --
`TO_NUMBER` | The number you are sending the SMS to, for example `447700900000`.
`NEXMO_API_KEY` | You can find this in your Nexmo Dashboard.
`NEXMO_API_SECRET` | You can find this in your Nexmo Dashboard.

```

## Try it out

When you run the example above, the text message will be sent to the mobile number specified with the Unicode characters intact.

> Note that Unicode messages can only contain 70 characters, rather than the usual 160. There's more information about this [on the help page](https://help.nexmo.com/hc/en-us/articles/204076866-How-long-is-a-single-SMS-body-)
