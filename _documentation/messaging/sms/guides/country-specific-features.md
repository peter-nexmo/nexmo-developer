# Country specific features

Find out how different SMS implementations in different markets and territories can affect your campaign.

## Overview

Countries have different technical standards and restrictions around the SMS standard. Nexmo sends the message you give us to the phone number you designate cheaply and efficiently.

## Features

Before you start your messaging campaign you need to plan if the following features are supported in the countries and locations you are sending messages to:

- **[Delivery Receipts](/messaging/sms/guides/delivery-receipts)** - When Nexmo sends an SMS to a carrier, the carrier should return a delivery receipt (DLR).
- **[Alphanumeric Sender IDs](/messaging/sms/guides/custom-sender-id)** - The Sender ID is the number or text shown on a handset when it displays a message. You set a custom Sender ID to better represent your brand.
- **[Concatenation & Encoding](/messaging/sms/guides/concatenation-and-encoding)** - When you send SMS with Nexmo you should be aware of how many parts your message is being sent as and what encoding is required to send your message.
