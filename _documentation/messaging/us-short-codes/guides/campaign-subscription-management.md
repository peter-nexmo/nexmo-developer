# Campaign Subscription Management

Messaging activities fall under the regulatory guidelines of several groups, depending on the nation in which you send the messages. For more information see [Pre approved US Short Codes compliance requirements](https://help.nexmo.com/hc/en-us/articles/204015403-Pre-approved-US-Short-Codes-compliance-requirements)

You use the *opt-in* API to:

* Create an opt-out process so a user can [unsubscribe to your campaign](#unsubscribe-to-your-campaign)
* [Resubscribe](#resubscribe-to-your-campaign) a user to you campaign

1. Listen to the incoming requests and manage your recipient mailing list accordingly.
2. Send a request.
3. Check the response.

## Unsubscribe to your campaign

Unsubscribe requests for Event Based Alerts are forwarded to the [webhook endpoint](/concepts/guides/webhooks) you set in [Dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/private/settings).

To handle unsubscribe requests:

1. Listen to the incoming unsubscribe requests and manage your recipient mailing list accordingly.
Once a recipient number has unsubscribed from your campaign, any outbound SMS to that number will be blocked.

2. Send a [request](/api/sms/us-short-codes/alerts/subscription#request) and see the list of phone numbers that are unsubscribed from your campaign:

```tabbed_examples
source: '/_examples/messaging/us-short-codes/guides/campaign-subscription-management/unsubscribe/request'
```

3. Check the [response](/api/sms/us-short-codes/alerts/subscription#response):

```tabbed_examples
source: '/_examples/messaging/us-short-codes/guides/campaign-subscription-management/unsubscribe/response'
```

## Resubscribe to your campaign

Resubscribe requests for Event Based Alerts are handled through your Website.

To handle resubscribe requests:

1. On your website, listen to the incoming resubscribe requests.

2. Send a [request](/api/sms/us-short-codes/alerts/subscription#request) to opt-in the phone number again:

```tabbed_examples
source: '/_examples/messaging/us-short-codes/guides/campaign-subscription-management/resubscribe/request'
```

3. Check the [response](/api/sms/us-short-codes/alerts/subscription#response):

```tabbed_examples
source: '/_examples/messaging/us-short-codes/guides/campaign-subscription-management/resubscribe/response'
```
