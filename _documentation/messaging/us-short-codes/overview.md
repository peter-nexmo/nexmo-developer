# US Short Codes Overview

Nexmo provides an API for sending SMS messages from a shared short code to mobile device users in the United States.

Due to [legal and regulatory requirements for use of US Short Codes](https://help.nexmo.com/hc/en-us/articles/204015403-Pre-approved-US-Short-Codes-compliance-requirements), approval is required by Nexmo to use the API. You can apply for a shared US Short Code via the [Nexmo Dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com) in the Numbers section. You will need to ensure that your application follows the best practices outlined at the link above.

Customers using the US Short Codes API use separate endpoints for sending messages to the standard [SMS API](/messaging/sms/overview).
