# Numbers Overview

You use a Nexmo virtual number to receive inbound communication from your users.

You rent each virtual number by the month. The renewal date is relative to the original subscription date. The rental price is automatically deducted from your Nexmo account on the same day every month. However, if you rented a virtual number on the last day of the month, the renewal date is last day of the next month. For example: 28/02/2015, 31/03/2015, 30/04/2015.
