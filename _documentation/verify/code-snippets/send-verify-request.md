# Send verification code

When you have collected a user's phone number, start the verification process by sending a [verify request](/api/verify#verify-request) to the Verify API.  

The Verify API returns a `request_id`. Use this to identify a specific verification request in subsequent calls to the API, such as when making a [check request](/verify/code-snippets/check-verify-request) to see if the user provided the correct code.

> **Note**: You are limited to a maximum of one verify request per second.
