# Mute a call

This code snippet mutes / unmutes a call.

## Example

Replace the following variables in the example code:

Key |	Description
-- | --
`UUID` | replace with the UUID of the call to modify.
`action` | the action to use in updating the call. In this case `mute` or `unmute`.

```code_snippets
source: '_examples/voice/mute-a-call'
application:
  type: voice
  use_existing: |
    Modifying an existing call requires that the <code>UUID</code> provided is a currently active call. To modify a call, you must use the same <code>NEXMO_APPLICATION_ID</code> and private key that were used to create the call.
```

## Try it out

When you run the code the call is muted or unmuted depending on the action specified.
