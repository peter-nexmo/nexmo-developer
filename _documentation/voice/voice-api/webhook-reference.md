# Voice API Webhooks Reference

Nexmo uses webhooks alongside its Voice API to enable your application to interact with the call. There are two webhook endpoints:

* [Answer webhook](#answer-webhook) is sent when a call is answered. This is for both incoming and outgoing calls.
* [Event webhook](#event-webhook) is sent for all the events that occur during a call. Your application can log, react to or ignore each event type.
* [Errors](#errors) are also delivered to the event webhook endpoint if they occur.

For more general information, check out our [webhooks guide](/concepts/guides/webhooks).

## Answer Webhook

When an incoming call is answered, an HTTP request is sent to the `answer_url` you specified when setting up the application. For outgoing calls, specify the `answer_url` when you make the call.

By default, the answer webhook will be a `GET` request but this can be overridden to `POST` by setting the `answer_method` field. For incoming calls, you configure these values when you create the application. For outgoing calls, you specify these values when making a call.

### Answer webhook data fields

Field | Example | Description 
 -- | -- | --
`to` | `442079460000` | The number the call came from (this could be your Nexmo number if the call is started programmatically)
`from` | `447700900000` | The call the number is to (this could be a Nexmo number or another phone number)
`uuid` | `aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-0123456789ab` | A unique identifier for this call
`conversation_uuid` | `CON-aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-0123456789ab` | A unique identifier for this conversation

### Answer webhook data field examples

For a `GET` request, the variables will be in the URL, like this:

```
/answer.php?to=442079460000&from=447700900000&conversation_uuid=CON-aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-0123456789ab&uuid=aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-0123456789ab
```

If you set the `answer_method` to `POST` then you will receive the request with JSON-format data in the body:

```
{
  "from": "442079460000",
  "to": "447700900000",
  "uuid": "aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-0123456789ab",
  "conversation_uuid": "CON-aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-0123456789ab"
}
```

### Responding to the answer webhook

Nexmo expect you to return an [NCCO](/voice/voice-api/ncco-reference) in JSON format containing the actions to perform.

## Event webhook

HTTP requests will arrive at the event webhook endpoint when there is any status change for a call. The URL will be the `event_url` you specified when creating your application unless you override it by setting a specific `event_url` when starting a call.

By default the incoming requests are `POST` requests with a JSON body. You can override the method to `GET` by configuring the `event_method` in addition to the `event_url`.

The format of the data included depends on which event has occurred:

* [`started`](#started)
* [`ringing`](#ringing)
* [`answered`](#answered)
* [`busy`](#busy)
* [`cancelled`](#cancelled)
* [`unanswered`](#unanswered)
* [`rejected`](#rejected)
* [`failed`](#failed)
* [`human/machine`](#human-machine)
* [`timeout`](#timeout)
* [`completed`](#completed)
* [`record`](#record)
* [`input`](#input)
* [`transfer`](#transfer)
