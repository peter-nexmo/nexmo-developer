# Route to a VBC Extension

This code snippet shows you how to connect an inbound call on a Vonage Business Cloud programmable number to an extension.

## Example

The following example shows how to receive the inbound call and immediately forward it to your chosen VBC extension.

You achieve this with a `connect` [action](/voice/voice-api/ncco-reference#connect) in the Nexmo Call Control Object (NCCO). Create an `endpoint` with a type of `vbc` and the `extension` you want to forward the call to.

```code_snippets
source: '_examples/vonage-business-cloud/number-programmability/vbc-route-to-extension'
application:
  type: voice
  name: 'Connect to VBC Extension Example'
```

## Try it out

When you call your Vonage Business Cloud programmable number it should immediately forward the call to the extension number you specified.
