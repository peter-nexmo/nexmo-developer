# Billing

Depending on how you use the Number Programmability service, you might receive bills from both Vonage and Nexmo.

* All charges for voice usage in the Number Programmability service applications you create are included in your Vonage Business Cloud bill.

* If your applications use other Nexmo capabilities (such as Number Insight or Messaging) then you will receive a separate bill from Nexmo for that usage.

> **Note** If you receive bills from both Vonage and Nexmo, the invoice schedule might not be the same.
