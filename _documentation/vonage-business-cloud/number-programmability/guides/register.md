# Register for the Service

To add the Number Programmability service to your Vonage Business Cloud account you must complete [this form](https://ww3.business.vonage.com/l/7772/2019-02-27/96tnpc).

Vonage will contact you when the service capability has been activated.

> When the Number Programmability service is active, the next step is to [create a Nexmo Voice Application](/vonage-business-cloud/number-programmability/guides/create-voice-application).
