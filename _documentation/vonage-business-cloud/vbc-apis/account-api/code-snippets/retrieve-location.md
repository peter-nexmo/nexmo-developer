# Retrieve Details of an Account Location

This example shows you how to use the Account API to retrieve details about a specific location associated with an account.

Replace the following placeholders in the example with your own details:

* `VBC_TOKEN` - a valid token (see [authentication](/vonage-business-cloud/vbc-apis/getting-started/authentication))
* `VBC_ACCOUNT_ID` - the account number the location is associated with
* `VBC_LOCATION_ID` - the location ID you want to retrieve details for

The response is a JSON object containing details about the location. See the [API documentation](/api/vonage-business-cloud/account?expandResponses=true#AccountCtrl.getLocationByID) for descriptions of the fields in the response.

      }
   },
