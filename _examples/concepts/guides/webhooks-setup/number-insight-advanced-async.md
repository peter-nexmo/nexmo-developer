The Number Insight Advanced API allows you to have the results of a number lookup sent synchronously or asynchronously.

Set the `callback` argument to a webhook URL to receive the lookup asynchronously.

See [Number Insight Advanced Async](/number-insight/code-snippets/number-insight-advanced-async) for more details.
