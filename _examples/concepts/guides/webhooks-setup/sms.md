Webhooks are used to deliver incoming messages and delivery receipts.

### Incoming messages

To set up the webhook used for incoming messages, go to the [Your Numbers](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/your-numbers) section of the Nexmo Dashboard. Click 'edit' for the virtual number and set the *Callback URL*.

You can also use the [nexmo-cli](https://github.com/nexmo/nexmo-cli) to set the incoming messages endpoint for an individual number.

### Delivery Receipts

See the [Delivery Receipts](/messaging/sms/guides/delivery-receipts) guide in the SMS documentation.
