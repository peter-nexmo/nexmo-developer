## Usage
This code shows how to send audio from the [Nexmo Voice API Websocket](https://developer.nexmo.com/voice/voice-api/guides/websockets) to  [Azure Speech-to-text](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/cognitive-services/speech-to-text/), it allows you obtain real time transcription of the callers speech.
