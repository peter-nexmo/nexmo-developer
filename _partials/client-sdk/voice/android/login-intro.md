To start using the Nexmo Client SDK you need to log in to `NexmoClient`, using a JWT user token.

In production apps, your server would authenticate the user, and would return a [correctly configured JWT](/client-sdk/concepts/jwt-acl) to your app.

For testing and getting started purposes, you can use the Nexmo CLI to [generate JWTs](/tutorials/client-sdk-generate-test-credentials).
