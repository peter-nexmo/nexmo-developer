For your application to connect an incoming phone call to an app user, you'll need to provide a URL as the `Answer URL` webhook - we've created a [gist](https://gist.github.com/NexmoDev/ed91ac99a0b278fbdcbde72ca3599ac7) for you to use.

To add this URL, go to your [Nexmo dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com), navigate to [applications](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/voice/your-applications), select your application and click the 'Edit' button.

Now, set the application's `Answer URL` to:

``https://gist.githubusercontent.com/NexmoDev/ed91ac99a0b278fbdcbde72ca3599ac7/raw/4a134363f8b3bbebae27f04095a57d0cebc5a1be/ncco.json``

and click 'Save changes'.

>NOTE: This gist is specific to this tutorial and in a real-life scenario, the `answer_url` should be provided by a purposely built web solution that can serve custom NCCOs if required.
