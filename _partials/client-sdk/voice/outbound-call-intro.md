In this guide, you'll learn how to place a phone call from a Nexmo application to a phone device (PSTN) by implementing a [webhook](/concepts/guides/webhooks) and linking that to a [Nexmo application](/concepts/guides/applications).

You will create an app to place a call. The app will log in a user called `Jane`. After logging in, Jane is able to place a call as well as to end it.
