In addition to being able to use Messages and Dispatch via the REST APIs, Nexmo also provides client library support. 

> **NOTE:** Currently client library support is only available for Node.

## Installation

During Beta, the Node client library containing support for the Messages and Dispatch API can be installed using:

``` bash
$ npm install --save nexmo@beta
```

If you already have the library installed the above command will upgrade your library to the latest version.

## Usage

If you decide to use the client library you will need the following information:

Key | Description
-- | --
`NEXMO_API_KEY` | The Nexmo API key which you can obtain from your [Nexmo Dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com).
`NEXMO_API_SECRET` | The Nexmo API secret which you can obtain from your [Nexmo Dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com).
`NEXMO_APPLICATION_ID` | The Nexmo Application ID for your Nexmo Application which can be obtained from your [Nexmo Dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com).
`NEXMO_APPLICATION_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` | The path to the `private.key` file that was generated when you created your Nexmo Application.

These variables can then be replaced with actual values in the client library example code.

## Examples

See the code snippets section for further examples on how to use the client library.
