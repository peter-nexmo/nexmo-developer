# How to Add the Nexmo Client SDK to your iOS App

In this tutorial you learn how to add the Nexmo Client SDK to your iOS app.

## Prerequisites

To use the Nexmo SDK for iOS, you need to have the following installed:

* Xcode 10 or later
* iOS 10 or later

## Add the SDK to your iOS Project

Open XCode with your iOS project.

You can either install the Nexmo Client SDK via CocoaPods or directly.

### CocoaPods

1. Open your project's `PodFile`. If you don't have one already, open a terminal and run the following commands:

    ```
    $ cd 'Project Dir'
    $ pod init
    ```

    Where `Project Dir` is the path to the parent directory of the `PodFile`.

2. Under your target add the `NexmoClient` pod. Replace `TargetName` with your actual target name.

    ```ruby
    target 'TargetName' do
        pod 'NexmoClient'
    end
    ```

    Make sure the pod file has the public CocoaPod specs repository source.

3. Install the Pod by opening a terminal and running the following command:

    ```
    $ cd 'Project Dir'
    $ pod update
    ```

    Where `Project Dir` is the path to the parent directory of the `PodFile`.

4. Open the `xcworkspace` with XCode and disable `bitcode` for your target.

5. In your code, import the `NexmoClient` library:  
   
    **Swift:**

    ```swift
    import NexmoClient  
    ```

    **Objective-C:**

    ```objective-c
    #import <NexmoClient/NexmoClient.h>;
    ```

### Frameworks

1. Download the Nexmo Client SDK and add it to your project.

2. Open the `xcworkspace` with XCode and disable `bitcode` for your target.

3. In your code, import the NexmoClient library:

    **Swift:**
    
    ```swift
    import NexmoClient  
    ```

    **Objective-C:**

    ```objective-c
    #import <NexmoClient/NexmoClient.h>;
    ```

## Add permissions

To use the in-app voice features, you need to add audio permissions:

1. In your `Info.plist` add a new row with 'Privacy - Microphone Usage Description' and a description for using the microphone. For example, `Audio Calls`.

2. In your code add a request for Audio Permissions:  

    **Swift**

    ```swift
    import AVFoundation

    func askAudioPermissions() {
        AVAudioSession.sharedInstance().requestRecordPermission { (granted:Bool) in
            NSLog("Allow microphone use. Response: %d", granted)
        }
    }
    ```

    **Objective-C**:

    ```objective-c
    #import <AVFoundation/AVAudioSession.h>

    - (void)askAudioPermissions {
        if ([[AVAudioSession sharedInstance] respondsToSelector:@selector(requestRecordPermission:)])
        {
            [[AVAudioSession sharedInstance] requestRecordPermission: ^ (BOOL granted)
            {
            NSLog(@"Allow microphone use. Response: %d", granted);
            }];
        }
    }
    ```

`AppDelegate` is the best place to do this.

## Using NXMClient in your app

### Login

1. Create a `NXMClient` object and login with a `jwt` user token. If necessary, you can read more about [generating the JWT](/client-sdk/concepts/jwt-acl).

    **Swift**:

    ```swift
    let client = NXMClient(token: "your token")
    client?.setDelegate(self)
    client?.login()
    ```

    **Objective-C**:

    ```objective-c
    NXMClient *client = [[NXMClient alloc] initWithToken:@"your token"];
    [client setDelegate:self];
    [client login];
    ```

    Note that `self` should implement the `NXMClientDelegate` protocol.  

2. On a successful login, the following delegate method is called with `NXMConnectionStatusConnected`:

    **Swift**:

    ```swift
    func connectionStatusChanged(_ status: NXMConnectionStatus, reason: NXMConnectionStatusReason)
    ```

    **Objective-C**:

    ```objective-c
    - (void)connectionStatusChanged:(NXMConnectionStatus)status reason:(NXMConnectionStatusReason)reason;
    ```

### Get current user info

After the login succeeds, the logged in user will be available via:

**Swift**:

```swift
let user = client.user
```

**Objective-C**:

```objective-c
NXMUser *user = client.user;
```

## Conclusion

You added the Nexmo Client SDK to your iOS app, and logged in to a `NXMClient` instance. You can now use the `NXMClient` client in your app, and use the Nexmo Client SDK functionality.
