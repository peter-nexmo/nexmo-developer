# Retrieve Conversation details

You can retrieve the details of a Conversation object for a voice call using the Conversation API.

While this tutorial looks at retrieving the details for an voice call, there are many possible scenarios that could have been looked at, such as a video call or a text chat session. It is hoped that this tutorial will provide insight into the structure of a Conversation, as the Conversation is an important object that underlies much of the Nexmo technology. It is a fundamental data structure for communication activities, as all communication takes place through a Conversation.

The setup you will have in this tutorial is illustrated in the following digram:

## In this tutorial

- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
- [Create a Nexmo application](#create-a-nexmo-application)
- [Create a JWT](#create-a-jwt)
- [Run your webhook server](#run-your-webhook-server)
- [Call your Nexmo Number](#call-your-nexmo-number)
- [Get the Conversation details](#get-the-conversation-details)
- [Conclusion](#conclusion)
- [Resources](#resources)

## Prerequisites

1. [Create a Nexmo account](/account/guides/management#create-and-configure-a-nexmo-account) - you won't get far without this.
2. [Rent a Nexmo Number](/account/guides/numbers#rent-virtual-numbers) - you should have a couple of Euros free credit. It's more than enough.
3. [Install the Nexmo Command Line tools](/tools) - you will need [Node](https://nodejs.org) installed but using nexmo CLI is quick and convenient.
4. You should have [Python 3](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) and [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) installed. These are required for your webhook server.

This tutorial assumes you will be running [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com) in order to run your [webhook](/concepts/guides/webhooks) server locally.

If you are not familiar with Ngrok, please refer to our [Ngrok tutorial](https://www.nexmo.com/blog/2017/07/04/local-development-nexmo-ngrok-tunnel-dr/) before proceeding.

You will also need access to two phones for this tutorial!

So, if you are ready to continue...

## Create a Nexmo Application

First you will need to create a Nexmo Application if you have not already done so:

``` bash
nexmo app:create "Conversation App" http://demo.ngrok.io:3000/webhooks/answer http://demo.ngrok.io:3000/webhooks/event --keyfile private.key
```

In this previous command you will need to replace `demo` by what applies to your setup.

Make a note of the generated Application ID (`APP_ID`), you will need this when you generate a JWT.

## Link a Nexmo Number to your Application

Assuming you have already rented a Nexmo Number (`NEXMO_NUMBER`), you can link your Nexmo Number with your application in the Dashboard or via the command line:

``` bash
nexmo link:app NEXMO_NUMBER APP_ID
```

## Create a JWT

The Conversation API is authenticated using JWTs. You can generate a JWT with the following command:

``` bash
JWT="$(nexmo jwt:generate private.key exp=$(($(date +%s)+86400)) application_id=APP_ID)"
```

You need to replace `APP_ID` with the ID for your application. Also, `private.key` is the key associated with this same application.

> **NOTE:** This JWT will be valid for one day.

You can then view the JWT with:

``` bash
echo $JWT
```

> **TIP:** You can verify your JWT at [jwt.io](https://jwt.io).

## Run your webhook server

You need to run a webhook server to help obtain the Conversation ID for the in-progress call. The following Python code will suffice:

``` python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from pprint import pprint

app = Flask(__name__)

ncco = [{
        "action": "connect",
        "endpoint": [{
            "type": 'phone',
            "number": 'TO_NUMBER'
        }]
}]

@app.route("/webhooks/answer")
def answer_call():
    params = request.args
    pprint(params)
    return jsonify(ncco)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(port=3000)
```

> **IMPORTANT:** You need to replace `TO_NUMBER` with the number of your second phone, phone 2 (Bob).

Run this webhook server locally with:

``` bash
python3 app.py
```

## Call your Nexmo Number

Dial your Nexmo Number with phone 1 (Alice). The inbound call is forwarded to your second phone, phone 2 (Bob). Answer the call on phone 2 (Bob). Do not cancel the call at this point.

Now check the logging produced by your webhook server. You should see something similar to:

```
...
{
   'conversation_uuid': 'CON-bc643220-2542-499a-892e-c982c4150c06',
   'from': '447700000001',
   'to': '447700000002',
   'uuid': '797168e24c19a3c45e74e05b10fef2b5'
}
...
```

You are interested only in the Conversation ID which has the form `CON-<uuid>`. Copy and paste that ID somewhere convenient.

## Get the Conversation details

You can retrieve details of the Conversation object for the current call by running the following command in another terminal tab.

> **NOTE:** You will need to make sure you replace `$CONVERSATION_ID` by the ID you obtained previously and `$JWT` by the JWT you created previously.

Obtain the Conversation details for the voice call with the following:

```code_snippets
source: '_examples/conversation/conversation/get-conversation'
```

This API call will give you a response similar to the following:

``` json

    "uuid": "CON-bc643220-2542-499a-892e-c982c4150c06",

This response is explained in more detail in the [Conversation](/conversation/concepts/conversation) topic.

You can now hang up phone 1 (Alice) and phone 2 (Bob) to terminate the call.
