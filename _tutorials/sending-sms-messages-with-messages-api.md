# Sending SMS messages with the Messages API

In this tutorial you will see how to send an SMS using the Messages API.

The same steps taken here can be easily modified to send a message across Viber Service Messages, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp.

## The steps

After the prerequisites have been met, the steps are as follows:

1. [Create a Nexmo Application](#create-a-nexmo-application)
2. [Send an SMS message](#send-an-sms-message)

```partial

```

## Send an SMS message

Sending an SMS message with the Messages API can be done with one API call, authenticated using the JWT you just created.

In the example code below you will need to replace the following variables with actual values:

Key | Description
-- | --
`FROM_NUMBER` | The phone number you are sending the message from.
`TO_NUMBER` | The phone number you are sending the message to.

> **NOTE:** Don't use a leading `+` or `00` when entering a phone number, start with the country code, for example 447700900000.

## Example

```code_snippets
source: '_examples/messages/send-sms'
```

This will send an SMS message to the destination number you specified.

> **TIP:** If testing using Curl you will need a JWT. You can see how to create one in the documentation on [creating a JWT](/messages/code-snippets/before-you-begin#generate-a-jwt).
